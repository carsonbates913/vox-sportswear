## Creating your own branch

When you start working on a new feature, it’s good to start a new branch because in case you mess up with can go back to your previous version. Working on a separate branch also ensures that the main branch won’t have as many merge issues.

You can create a branch using: git checkout -b “enter-branch-name”
You can check the local branch using: git branch

Flow for saving your change：

1. 'git add .' : process all the edits you made
2. 'git commit -m “include a message”' : Bbsically the save button

   If you’re ready to finalize the change, you can make a push on your branch which would end up showing on Git Hub. The first time you want to push a new branch up to a remote repository, you will be asked to set it upstream. I usually just copy the command it recommended me to use.

3. 'git push' : submit your save changes to the git repository, meaning other people can also access

Once you are ready to finalize your changes, you can make a pull request on git up which helps ensure there are no merge errors before merging with the main branch

## Pulling from / merging with other people's branches
